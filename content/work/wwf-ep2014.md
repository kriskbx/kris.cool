#### Challenges

As candidate you were able to create a public profile and choose what aspects of environmental protection you would prioritize in your own policy making. As voter you were able to see a list of all candidates and invite them to the platform. The campaign was a huge success: Over 500+ candidates from all over the EU signed up. The key challenge was the internationalization of the platform which was translated into 9 different languages and how to make it as accessible as possible for the WWF editorial staff. So I built a backend to manage the translations and avoid sending around translation files. 

I was really happy to work on a project that reflected my personal priorities and to create a small positive impact with my work.
