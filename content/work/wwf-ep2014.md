As candidate you were able to create a public profile and choose what aspects of environmental protection you would prioritize in your own policy making. As voter you were able to see a list of all candidates and invite them to the platform via email or social media. The campaign was a huge success: Over 500+ candidates from all over the EU signed up.

One of the key challenges in this project was the internationalization of the platform which was translated into 9 different languages. We thought a lot about how to make it as accessible as possible for the WWF editorial staff. So I built a backend to manage the translations and avoid sending around translation files. Which was quite a complex task in these early CakePHP times.

In addition I was really happy to work on a project that reflected my personal views and to create a small positive impact with my work.
