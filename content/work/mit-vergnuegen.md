#### Challenges

While the backend is still a WordPress site, the frontend is a powerful Laravel application which interacts with the WP database directly. To achieve this I contributed to several open source projects and created my own package to map the horrible formatted WP data to something that's fun to work with. 

One key challenge was the interactive map that shows curated places to eat, drink, shop, dance, etc. It's written in Vue.js with the powerful Leaflet.js mapping library underneath. The map is also part of a lot of content elements that allows the editorial team to show their favorite running routes or e.g. list the 11 best burger places in town.
