#### Challenges

One of the key challenges in this project was building a fairly complex platform, including the checkout process, mass onboarding of employees and integrations in existing LMS systems. As well as creating and maintaining the necessary infrastructure to run the platform scalably on AWS within the given compliance and security guidelines. We chose Docker Swarm over Kubernetes to keep complexity of the infrastructure low and used Terraform within GitLab CI to deploy everything to production.
