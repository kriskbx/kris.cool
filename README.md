### Wut?

I'm hosting this on one of my Hetzner/AMD root servers with Docker Swarm. Yeah, I know this is probably overkill for a static website, but there's a lot more stuff on that server. A Traefik v2 instance handles certificates and routing, deployment is done via GitLab CI. Yaaas, GitLab. I think GitLab is superior to GitHub when it comes to anything DevOps related. You can sip a small chunk of the best practise GitLab CI config that I developed since I started using docker around 2015 in this repo.
