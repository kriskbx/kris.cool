          Hej again. ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kris and Iâ€™m the guy with that cool domain
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working professionally in the software industry since
          completing my Bachelor of Engineering degree back in 2012. Over the
          years, I've primarily worked as a freelancer for web and software
          development, as well as at companies like
          <a href="https://tiptap.dev">TipTap</a> (formerly known as Ã¼berdosis)
          and <a href="https://www.iu-group.com">IU Group</a>. Since 2024, I'm a
          part of <a href="https://sozialhelden.de">Sozialheld:innen e.V.</a>,
          where I help address social issues with technology and fight for a
          more inclusive world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, you can find me
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/kriskbx"
            >filming and editing short videos </a
          >, going for cycling or hiking trips, spending time outdoors, and
          tinkering with my home network and server. I have a passion for birds,
          science, open-source projects, self-hosting, and Indie/HC-Punk music.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my full-time role, I occasionally take on freelance
          jobs in design, video production, or coding. I also have an extensive
          network of skilled freelancers and agencies at my disposal, so feel
          free to reach out if you need someone with expertise in these areas!
