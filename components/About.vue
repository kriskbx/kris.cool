          Hej again. ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kris and Iâ€™m the guy with that cool domain
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working professionally in this industry since I've got my
          bachelor of engineering degree in 2012, mainly as a freelance web and
          software developer. In 2018 I decided to give up being a freelancer,
          because I really enjoy working with other amazing people in a team. At
          first I helped
          <a href="https://tiptap.dev">Ã¼berdosis (which is now Tiptap)</a>
          building software for clients and created & maintained open source
          projects. In 2021 I joined
          <a href="https://www.iu-group.com">IU Groups</a> effort to empower
          everyone with education to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          After work, I
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/kriskbx">film & edit short videos</a>, go
          cycling, hiking, spend time outdoors and tinker with my home network &
          server. I like birds, longboards, science, open-source, self-hosting
          and Indie/HC-Punk music.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time I also take freelance jobs for design,
          video-production or coding. I also got a large network of nice and
          skilled fellow freelancers and agencies, so hit me up if you got
          something.
