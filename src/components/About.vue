                    <p>Hej again. ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kris and Iâ€™m the guy with that cool domain name.</p>
                    <p>I've been working professionally in this industry since I've got my bachelor of engineering degree in 2012, mainly as a freelance web and software developer. In 2018 I decided to give up being a freelancer, because I really enjoy working with other amazing people in a team. At first I helped <a href="https://ueber.io" target="_blank">Ã¼berdosis</a> building software for clients and created & maintained open source projects. In 2021 I joined <a href="https://www.iu-group.com/" target="_blank">IU Group</a> to help them bringing education to everybody.</p>

                    <p>Quick out of context trivia: Out of pure curiosity I studied "aeronautics and space engineering" for a couple of semesters besides my day job. I love STEM stuff and wanted to learn something new.</p>

                  <p>After work, I <a href="https://vimeo.com/kriskbx" target="_blank">film & edit short videos</a>, go cycling, hiking, spend time outdoors and organize small underground concerts. I like birds, longboards, science and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3QgzseDIOG1zd2WIA37D5j" target="_blank">Indie</a>/<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0r8oK6NC6oHy8neqv4oIUo?si=9b09cd4e48914d65" target="_blank">HC-Punk</a> music.</p>

                  <p>From time to time I also take freelance jobs for design, video-production or coding. I also got a large network of nice and skilled fellow freelancers and agencies, so hit me up if you got something.</p>
