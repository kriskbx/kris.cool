                    <p>Hej again. ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kris and Iâ€™m the guy with that cool domain name.</p>
                    <p>In 2012 I got my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mediaproduction & Mediatechnology. Since
                        then I worked for an international Garden Exhibition as Graphic Designer, for several
                        clients & agencies as Freelance Full Stack Developer and at <a href="https://ueber.io" target="_blank">Ã¼berdosis</a>
                        as Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer. Since 2021 Iâ€™m at <a href="https://iu.de" target="_blank">IU - International University of applied sciences</a>
                        as Senior Full Stack Developer.</p>
                    <p>Out of pure curiosity I studied "Transport Systems: Aeronautics and space engineering" for a couple of semesters besides my day job. I love STEM stuff and wanted to learn something new.</p>
                    <p>I also make cool short films and videos. <a href="https://vimeo.com/kriskbx" target="_blank">At
                        first as freelancer</a> for clients & agencies but now
                        itâ€™s more of a hobby.</p>
                    <p>From time to time I also take freelance jobs for design, videoproduction or coding. I also got a large network of nice and skilled fellow freelancers and agencies, so hit me up if you got something.</p>    
                    <p>Personally I like birds, science, hiking & being outdoors, longboards as well as Indie/Hardcore-Punk music.</p>
