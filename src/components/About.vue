                    <p>Hej again. ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kris and Iâ€™m the guy with that cool domain name.</p>
                    <p>In 2012 I got my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mediaproduction & Mediatechnology. Since
                        then I worked for an international Garden Exhibition as Graphic Designer and for several
                        clients & agencies as Freelance Developer. Since 2019 Iâ€™m at <a href="https://ueber.io"
                                                                                        target="_blank">Ã¼berdosis</a>
                        as Senior Fullstack
                        Developer and DevOps Engineer.</p>
                    <p>I also make cool shortfilms and videos. <a href="https://vimeo.com/kriskbx" target="_blank">At
                        first as freelancer</a> for clients & agencies but now
                        itâ€™s more of a hobby.</p>
                    <p>Personally I like birds, sloths & anteaters, hiking & beeing outdoors, longboards and
                        Indie/Punk music. I believe in a better world and try to take responsibility by living plant
                        based and as sustainable as I can.</p>
