Hey there, I'm **Kris**: the guy with that cool domain name. I'm also a freelance __webdev__ and __videoproducer__.

I built my first website in 2001, got a "Bachelor of Engineering" degree, worked for a marketing/web agency as a developer, a movie/tv production company as a cutter/runner/assistent and an international garden exhibition as a designer.

Personally I like penguins, sloths, mate soda and tea, boards with rolls (and boards on snow), cooking vegan stuff and all kinds of soapbubbles that exist within the inner solarsystem. I don't know soapbubbles from the outer solarsystem yet. Maybe they are… well… ugly?!

I'm a big fan of open source software and publish many things I make under MIT or GPL on GitHub.

Yay, tableflip. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
