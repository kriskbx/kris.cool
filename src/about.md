Hey there, I'm **Kris Siepert**: the guy with that cool domain name. I'm also a freelance __webdev__ and __videoproducer__.

I built my first website in 2001, got a "Bachelor of Engineering" degree, worked for a marketing/web agency as a developer, a movie/tv production company as a cutter/runner/assistent and an international garden exhibition as a designer.

Personally I like penguins, sloths, [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29){:target="_blank"}, boards with rolls, cooking veggie stuff and all kinds of soapbubbles that exist within the inner solarsystem. I don't know soapbubbles from the outer solarsystem yet. Maybe they are… well… ugly?!

I love [Käptn Peng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqRWMDv0r78){target="_blank"}, [The Bronx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2iwlYYyLwE){target="_blank"}, [Irie Revoltes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pazLZoTRec){target="_blank"} and [John Coffey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGx4g5WxK68){target="_blank"}.

I'm a big fan of open source software and publish many things I make under MIT or GPL on GitHub. (Link is in the footer)
