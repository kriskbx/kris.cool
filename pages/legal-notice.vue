  <h3>Liability for Contents</h3>

  <p>
    As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites
    according to Sec. 7, paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However,
    according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers are
    not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to
    search for evidences that indicate illegal activities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of
    information remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at
    the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents
    will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.
  </p>

  <h3>Liability for Links</h3>

  <p>
    Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no
    influence on the contents of those websites, therefore we cannot guarantee
    for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked websites are
    always responsible for their own contents.
  </p>

  <p>
    The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the
    time of the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at
    the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked
    websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has
    been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at the
    time we get knowledge of them.
